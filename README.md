## Overview  
CoralBase is an open-source web platform that helps researchers, conservationists, and marine biologists track, analyze, and combat Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD). Using AI-powered image recognition, crowdsourced data, and interactive visualizations, CoralBase enables better detection and understanding of coral diseases.  

## Problem Statement  
Coral reefs are one of the most important ecosystems on the planet, supporting 25% of marine life, protecting coastal areas, and contributing to global biodiversity. However, SCTLD has been devastating reefs, spreading across the Caribbean and beyond. Despite its severity, tracking SCTLD remains a major challenge due to limited data-sharing platforms and real-time analysis tools.

### **CoralBase solves this by:**  
‚úÖ Providing a centralized research hub for SCTLD studies.  
‚úÖ Automating disease identification using AI-powered image and video recognition.  
‚úÖ Enabling data-driven conservation efforts through interactive visualizations.  
‚úÖ Fostering collaboration among marine researchers worldwide.  

## üöÄ Features  
### AI-Powered Disease Detection
- Uses computer vision to analyze uploaded coral images/videos and detect signs of SCTLD.  
- Provides confidence scores and highlights affected areas.  

### **Research Database**  
- Allows researchers to upload and search reports. 

### **Interactive Disease Maps**  
- Displays real-time coral disease spread using geotagged data.  
- Allows users to visualize locations of reports saved within the databse.  

### **Graphs & Analytics**  
- Generates visual reports on number of reports per country, and recent reports.  

### **Community Collaboration**  
- Researchers can discuss findings, comment on studies, and share insights.
- Encourages crowdsourced data collection from divers, marine biologists, and conservationists.
