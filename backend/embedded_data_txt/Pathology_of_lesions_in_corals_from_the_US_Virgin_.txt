180   Coral Reefs (2025) 44:179–192  with differences in bacterial flora between healthy and dis- eased corals (Rosales et al. 2023) has led some to assume that SCTLD may have a bacterial etiology, but no causative pathogen has been identified. Moreover, it is unclear whether lesion regression in corals treated with antibiotics is due to antibacterial effects of antibiotics or other factors. Some antibiotics have properties above and beyond killing bacteria that could be causing regression of lesions in corals. For instance, the antibiotic doxycycline used to treat skin lesions in humans has anti-inflammatory properties that could aid resolution of lesions (Henehan et al. 2017). Gross and microscopic pathology are fundamental to understanding pathogenesis and sometimes causes of dis- eases in animals (Cheville 1988). Pathology might shed light on SCTLD; however, whilst microscopic pathology is commonly used to understand disease in vertebrates (Che- ville 1988) and even shellfish (Carella et al. 2015), its use in coral disease investigations continues to be uncommon (Work and Meteyer 2014). In a recent review of papers on SCTLD (Papke et al. 2024), only three presented informa- tion on microscopic pathology. One study from Florida suggested SCTLD was the result of a dysfunction between host cells and zooxanthellae in deeper tissues leading to cell death and gross lesions of SCTLD (Landsberg et al. 2020); no evidence of bacteria or other causative microorganisms were visible on light microscopy. Subsequent studies using electron microscopy of corals from Florida showed dam- age to endosymbionts associated with filamentous viral-like particles (VLP) (Work et al. 2021). Molecular evidence of filamentous viruses was confirmed from corals in the US Virgin Islands (USVI) (Veglia et al. 2022). However, since that study, VLP similar to those seen in endosymbionts of Florida corals were seen in apparently healthy (disease-free) corals in the Caribbean and Pacific (Howe-Kerr et al. 2023), so a viral etiology for SCTLD remains to be confirmed. The lack of clarity on exactly what constitutes SCTLD persists. For instance, in the original description, the dis- ease was defined by corals manifesting tissue loss (Precht et al. 2016), but more recent studies now define SCTLD to include tissue loss with bleaching response (Aeby et al. 2021), or even discoloration (Lucas et al. 2024). From a pathology perspective, the current case definition of SCTLD stipulates acute to subacute tissue loss with microscopic evi- dence of lytic necrosis of gastrodermis of basal body wall, and endosymbiont degeneration and necrosis (Landsberg et al. 2020) Given the opacity of how SCTLD is defined in the western Atlantic Ocean, additional studies on pathology of corals in regions outside of Florida might help refine the case definition. The USVI are an important area for coral reef ecosys- tems in the Caribbean, because they harbor several impor- tant marine protected areas and other locations of particular concern dedicated to protecting coral reefs (Pittman et al. 2014). Diseases in corals have been seen in the USVI since at least the 1980s when white band disease was first noticed by Gladfelter (1982), with subsequent observations of the coral disease white plague by Miller et al. (2003). In 2005, the USVI and other areas in the eastern Caribbean under- went a major bleaching event concomitant with disease that accelerated coral reef declines (Miller et al. 2009; Rogers et al. 2009). SCTLD was first noticed in the USVI at south- west St. Thomas in early 2019 and spread east to St. John by 2020 affecting mainly   Colpophyllia natans, Eusmilia fastigiata, Montastraea cavernosa, Orbicella   spp., and  Pseudodiploria strigosa   (Brandt et al. 2021). Experimental trials to transmit SCTLD showed that   Orbicella annularis, Colpophyllia natans,   and   Siderastrea siderea   were most sus- ceptible, and histology of experimentally induced lesions had vague resemblance to those of wild collected Florida corals (Meiling et al. 2021). To gain a better understanding of the case definition of SCTLD and how it might apply to corals in the USVI, we described the gross and microscopic pathology of corals from that region.  Methods  Three locations in St. John were selected for sampling in July 2021 (Fig. 1). SCTLD first appeared in USVI on the island of St. Thomas in January 2019 and had reached St. John and other islands in the Caribbean by January 2020 (Brandt et al. 2021), so our sampling effort was over a year after initial incursion of the disease on that island. Tektite and Yawzi reefs are adjacent to a relatively undeveloped watershed, and have a multi-decade history of coral moni- toring with reefs dominated by   Montastraea cavernosa ,  Orbicella   spp.,   Porites   spp.,   Colpophylia   spp., and other coral species with known susceptibility to SCTLD that have undergone bleaching events in the past (Whelan et al. 2007; Miller et al. 2009) where sea surface temperatures at the time were 0.7–1.2C warmer than historical averages reach- ing to 30.2C. Hawksnest Bay reef has large well-developed patch reefs geographically distant (north vs. south side [Tektite Bay and Yawzi Point reefs]) from the other sites but adjacent to a more developed watershed. Samples from 79 coral colonies were haphazardly collected between 7–14 July 2021 from four sites (Table 1; Fig. 1) (Work 2013). Briefly, paired apparently normal and lesion samples from colonies manifesting gross lesions, and fragments from some corals not manifesting lesions, were processed for histopa- thology including routine paraffin embedding and staining with hematoxylin and eosin (Landsberg et al. 2020).

Lesions for sampling were chosen haphazardly to broadly reflect what was encountered on the reef at the time of the inves- tigation (Table 2). A subset of tissues selected to represent the variety of light microscopic lesions encountered was also examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as described (Work et al. 2021) (Table 3). Changes at the cellular level were described separately for the coral host and endosymbionts. For host cells, changes included lytic mucus cell hypertrophy exemplified by enlarged mucus cells distorting tissue architecture (Fig. 3A) sometimes accompanied by necrosis characterized by clumping of cells with hypereosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic or karyor- rhectic nuclei (Fig. 3B-D). Periodic acid Schiff-alcian-blue pH 2.5 (PAS-AB) stain was used to distinguish acidic and neu- tral mucin (Yamabayashi 1987) (Fig. 3E, F). Other host cell changes noted included atrophy characterized by decreased cell size (Fig. 4B; compare with Fig. 4A), and hyperplasia characterized by increased cell numbers (Fig. 4C). Changes in endosymbionts were noted as intracytoplasmic vacuolation (Fig. 4D). We also noted presence of non-host structures such as sponges, ciliates, cell-associated bacterial aggregates, coc- cidia (Fig. 4E) and fungi or algae (Fig. 4F) (Hawthorn et al. 2023). Host cell changes and non-host organisms were further partitioned as to their location in tissue compartments includ- ing epidermis/gastrodermis of surface or basal body wall, mes- enterial filaments, calicodermis, or skeleton. For each coral genus manifesting a particular gross lesion type, we calculated the percent of each microscopic lesion type seen in apparently  Fig. 1   Locations of corals col- lected on July 2021 on St. John, US Virgin Islands  Table 1   Location and number of colonies sampled for histopathology partitioned by location and species.

When stained with PAS- alcian-blue, gastrodermis in diseased colonies shifted from magenta PAS positive (Fig. 3E) to alcian-blue positive acidic mucins (Fig. 3F), and cells with mucus cell lytic hypertro- phy stained pale magenta PAS positive indicative of neutral mucins (Fig. 3F). On electron microscopy, necrosis was exemplified by cellular disorganization, cytoplasmic blebbing and karyor- rhexis (Fig. 6B compare with Fig. 6A). Mucus cell lytic hypertrophy was exemplified by variably sized accumula- tions of mucus (Fig. 6C) associated with cell membrane rupture (Fig. 6D). Endosymbiont pathology included vari- ably sized intracellular cavities containing electron dense debris (Fig. 7A, B), gigantism of chloroplast, increased spac- ing between thylakoid membranes (Fig. 7B), dissociation of thylakoid membranes (Fig. 7C), or fusing of thylakoid membranes (Figs. 7D, E).

186   Coral Reefs (2025) 44:179–192  examined by TEM, debris-filled cavities in endosymbionts were the most commonly seen lesion followed by lytic mucus cell hypertrophy in host cells (Table 3).  Discussion  The main host response in corals from the USVI was mul- tifocal to locally extensive lytic hypertrophy of mucus cells sometimes associated with necrosis of gastrodermis of the surface and basal body wall. Endosymbionts also manifested pathology in the form of variably sized cavities filled with unidentified debris. Notably pathology of corals from the USVI differed from those in Florida in terms of histology and electron microscopy (Table 5). On histol- ogy, the main lesion in Florida corals was multifocal lytic necrosis of gastrodermis of surface and basal body wall (Landsberg et al. 2020), but this lesion often extended into the mesoglea, something which was not evident in corals from the USVI. In this context, the lesions we observed were more in alignment with those seen on histology dur- ing experimental transmission trials of SCTLD in cor- als from the USVI (Meiling et al. 2021). Pathology of endosymbionts also differed from that seen in corals from Florida in that we did not see intracytoplasmic refractile vacuoles (Landsberg et al. 2020). Rather, endosymbiont pathology seen in USVI corals manifested as varying degrees of intracytoplasmic vacuolation. On electron microscopy, corals from the USVI, like those of Florida, showed host cell response of excessive mucus produc- tion, gigantism of chloroplasts with thylakoid membrane abnormalities, and presence of intracytoplasmic cavities containing varying amounts of electron dense material. However, in contrast to Florida corals, there was a nota- ble absence of asymmetric viral-like particles (Work et al. 2021). This brings into doubt just what role viruses play in causing SCTLD, at least outside of Florida. As in Flor- ida, corals from USVI had microscopic lesions in appar- ently normal fragments from lesioned colonies, and there appeared to be little relationship between gross and micro- scopic lesions, a phenomenon also noted in Florida corals with SCTLD (Landsberg et al. 2020). Many corals also had overgrowth of skeleton by a mix of filamentous algae and fungi to which coral hosts responded by calicodermal hypertrophy or necrosis (Fig. 4F). The presence of a host response to those endolithic organisms suggests they were having some adverse effect on coral health, a phenomenon that has been documented elsewhere. For instance, dark spots in   Siderastrea   in the Caribbean are associated with overgrowth of fungi (Work and Weil 2015). Rich et al. (2021) saw endolithic organisms with similar associated basal body wall changes in   Pseudodiploria   (and other spe- cies) with and without growth anomalies in St Kitts sug- gesting that endolithic organisms may not be an essential  Table 4   Number (percent) of microscopic lesions number seen by genus for corals collected from US Virgin Islands.

Evaluating corals elsewhere in the Caribbean might shed additional light on the role of endolithic organisms in coral health in the region. The absence of TEM lesions in apparently nor- mal corals (Table 3) suggests the changes seen here both at the light- and electron-microscope level are true pathol- ogy and not mere sampling artifact as implied elsewhere (Papke et al. 2024). Moreover, if all of what we are seeing is collection artifact, it should affect tissues uniformly and we would not have segmental distribution of lesions as seen here. As an example, fish gills are prone to collection artifacts, but those generally manifest as a uniform change (Wolf et al. 2015). The differences in pathology of SCTLD in Florida vs USVI, summarized in Table 5, could be explained by tem- poral or geographic variation. Florida corals were sampled between 2016 and 2018 whereas USVI corals were sampled in 2021. Possibly, manifestation of disease has changed over this time interval. Changes in manifestation of disease over time is not unusual. For instance, highly pathogenic avian  Fig. 5   Heatmap of gross vs histologic lesions in samples partitioned by genus.

188   Coral Reefs (2025) 44:179–192  influenza H5N1 is known to circulate in wild waterfowl and rarely causes disease in those birds. In the early 2000s, H5N1 caused limited mortality in bar-headed geese when it emerged in China in the early 2000s (Chen et al. 2006) how- ever, in the early 2020s, it has caused unprecedented and sig- nificant mortality in marine mammals and seabirds in South America (Leguia et al. 2023). Geographic variation could also explain the differences between USVI and Florida. Even though both regions contain similar assemblages of coral species, these animals may manifest disease in different ways. An example is fibropapillomatosis, a disease associ- ated with Chelonid herpesvirus 5 that causes tumors in green turtles ( Chelonia mydas ) in Florida and Hawaii. In Hawaii, the disease has been declining (Chaloupka et al. 2009), and turtles there commonly manifest oral tumors (Aguirre et al. 2002) whereas in Florida, the disease continues to persist at high prevalence and oral tumors are rare (Foley et al. 2005). Turtles in Hawaii and Florida also have a different immuno- logical response to the virus (Work et al. 2020). Both above examples referring to temporal or spatial vari- ation in disease manifestation apply to gross presentation of diseases with known etiologies (avian influenza associated with orthomyxovirus and fibropapillomatosis associated with herpesvirus). However, at the cellular level, the tissue pathology for these diseases is invariant. For example, his- tology of fibropapillomatosis in Florida green turtles (Herbst et al. 1999) is similar to that of Hawaiian green turtles (Agu- irre et al. 1998). Likewise, histology of avian influenza in poultry from South America is similar to that seen in similar birds from North America (Jones and Swayne 2004; Zhou et al. 2006; Neufeld et al. 2009). Given this, the difference in microscopic pathology seen in corals from Florida vs USVI prompts the question of whether SCTLD in both regions might have different etiologies. What is causing lytic mucus cell hypertrophy in corals from the USVI is unclear. Cnidaria often produce exces- sive mucus as a host response to chemical insults such as exposure to drilling muds, crude oil, dredge spoils, or heavy metal, a topic reviewed in Brown and Bythell (2005). However, we have no evidence that corals sam- pled here were exposed to such compounds. Mucus in corals is secreted in a condensed form that subsequently swells upon hydration (Brown and Bythell 2005).   Per- haps increase in cell or vesicle membrane permeability is allowing excessive influx of water and hydration of mucus, leading to cell lysis and necrosis of mucus cells.

The paler staining in areas of mucus cell lytic hypertrophy (Fig. 3F) would suggest dilution of those mucins with water which would fit altered mem- brane permeability and influx of water into the cells with swelling and rupture of membranes (Fig. 6D). Confirming such a mechanism would require more systematic investi- gations of cell membrane integrity, something beyond the purview of microscopy. Finally, it is possible that given its widespread occurrence, lytic mucus cell hypertrophy could be a non-specific host response incidental to tissue loss. Resolving this could be done by sampling corals before and after incursion of SCTLD at a cite to see if this lesion is present at both time points. Given the lack of infectious agents evident on light and electron microscopy, infectious agents do not appear respon- sible for the host response seen here and would contrast with the accepted belief that bacteria are causing SCTLD (Papke et al. 2024). As in Florida, corals had notable pathology in endosymbionts that differed only in the absence of viral-like particles. Based on TEM findings in Florida, Work et al. (2021) surmised that endosymbiont pathology in Florida corals could be caused by either viruses or toxicosis. In addi- tion to viruses, Work et al. (2021) hypothesized that corals afflicted with SCTLD may be responding to toxins produced by endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. Toxins from coral endo- symbionts (Nakamura et al. 1993) have been implicated in causation of coral bleaching (McConnaughey 2012). It is well known that many algal toxins interfere with mem- brane ion channels and cell membrane permeability (Wang 2008). Interestingly, cell swelling is a common denominator of cellular damage in cases of marine toxin poisoning. For instance, in mammals, domoic acid causes vacuolation of nerve cells (Pulido 2008) whereas yessotoxin causes fluid accumulation and swelling of heart cells (Terao et al. 1990). Perhaps compromised endosymbionts generate toxins that lead to inability of the coral host to maintain cell membrane homeostasis leading to lytic mucus cell hypertrophy. The diverse pathologies seen herein suggest that SCTLD is more complex than a “single etiology”, and evaluating the pathol- ogy of the condition elsewhere might help refine our case definition.
