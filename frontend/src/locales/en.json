      "description": "SCTLD (Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease) is a highly lethal coral disease that was first identified off the coast of Miami, Florida in 2014. The disease appears as rapidly spreading white lesions on coral colonies that can kill entire coral colonies within weeks or months. It affects over 20 different species of hard corals, with some species like brain corals and pillar corals being particularly susceptible. Unlike some other coral diseases, SCTLD has proven to be unusually persistent and virulent, spreading throughout the Caribbean Sea and causing unprecedented coral mortality rates. Scientists believe it is caused by bacterial pathogens, though the exact cause remains under investigation. The disease has had devastating impacts on coral reef ecosystems, with some areas experiencing up to 60-100% mortality of susceptible species, leading to significant ecological and economic consequences for affected regions.",
